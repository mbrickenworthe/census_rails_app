This is a uniqueness app that takes into account many different APIs to figure out just how unique an individual really is.

The census API, with keys below, is used to in accordance with a user's age, race, and state to understand their uniqueness in the year 2010 per each state.

Using a geolocation gem, I'm able to apply that data directly to a GoogleMaps.
